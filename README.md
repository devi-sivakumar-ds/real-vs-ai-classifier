# Real vs AI Image Classifier

This project explores image classification techniques with a focus on feature extraction, specifically designed to distinguish between real and AI-generated images.

## Project Overview

The project consists of two main implementations:

1. **Initial Implementation (`real_vs_ai_classifier.ipynb`)**
   - Contains the first iteration of the classifier
   - Focuses on basic feature extraction and model training
   - Includes some overfitted models that were used for initial experimentation

2. **Improved Implementation (`real_vs_ai_classifier_v2.ipynb`)**
   - Enhanced version with improvements to prevent overfitting
   - Utilizes a mixed dataset approach for better generalization
   - Implements refined feature extraction techniques
   - Includes better model architecture and training procedures

## Purpose

This project aims to:
- Study and implement various feature extraction techniques for image classification
- Compare different approaches to handling real vs AI-generated image classification
- Demonstrate the evolution of model improvements from initial overfitted versions to more robust solutions
